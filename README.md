# Salifort-Motors-Turnover-Prediction-Project

## ðŸ’¡ Project Summary:

A data-driven analysis of Employee Turnover at a fictional French company, leveraging machine learning models (including Random Forest, XGBoost, Tuned Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) to uncover key behaviors and predict churn. This project, completed in Python, includes two competing executive summaries and a full Jupyter Notebook detailing the complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), five rounds of machine learning model development and results, and suggested solutions to resolve employee turnover.

## ðŸ“° The Business Scenario and Problem:

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they donâ€™t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
